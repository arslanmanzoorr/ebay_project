# 🚀 How to Deploy Your App (Super Simple Guide!)

Hey! This guide will help you get your app running on the internet. Think of it like following a recipe - just do each step and you'll be fine!

## 📋 What You Need First

- **Docker Desktop** installed on your computer
- **Git** (to download your code)
- **A computer** (duh!)

## 🔧 Step 1: Get Your Code Ready

### 1.1 Open Command Prompt/Terminal
- **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
- **Mac**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, press Enter

### 1.2 Go to Your Project Folder
```bash
cd "D:\Work\ebay_project\ebay_project"
```

## 🔑 Step 2: Create Your Secret Password

### 2.1 Generate a Secret Key
Copy and paste this command:
```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

### 2.2 Copy the Result
You'll see something like this (it's long and weird-looking):
```
kqzx^w%61wi6du#c%f*!#k!i&!j$3_29pyq1!js_#5bh%bzmij
```

**Copy the whole thing!** (Right-click and select "Copy" or Ctrl+C)

## 📝 Step 3: Create Your Settings File

### 3.1 Copy the Template
```bash
copy env.prod.template .env.prod
```

### 3.2 Edit the File
- Right-click on `.env.prod` file
- Select "Open with" → "Notepad" (or any text editor)

### 3.3 Change These Lines
Find these lines and change them:

**OLD (change this):**
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=auctionpass123-change-this
```

**NEW (put your actual values):**
```bash
SECRET_KEY=kqzx^w%61wi6du#c%f*!#k!i&!j$3_29pyq1!js_#5bh%bzmij
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=my-super-secret-password-123
```

**IMPORTANT:** 
- Replace the SECRET_KEY with the long weird text you copied earlier
- Make up a strong password for POSTGRES_PASSWORD (like: `my-super-secret-password-123`)

### 3.4 Save the File
- Press `Ctrl + S`
- Close the text editor

## 🐳 Step 4: Deploy Your App!

### 4.1 Run the Deployment Script
**If you're on Windows:**
```bash
.\deploy-prod.ps1
```

**If you're on Mac/Linux:**
```bash
./deploy-prod.sh
```

### 4.2 Wait for Magic to Happen
You'll see lots of text scrolling by. This is normal! Just wait until you see:
```
✅ Production deployment completed successfully!
```

**This might take 5-10 minutes the first time.**

## 🌐 Step 5: Check if It Worked!

### 5.1 Open Your Web Browser
### 5.2 Go to These URLs:
- **Your App**: http://localhost:3000
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8000/admin

### 5.3 Login to Admin
- Username: `admin`
- Password: (you'll need to set this)

## 🎉 You're Done!

Your app is now running! Here's what you can do:

## 📊 How to Manage Your App

### Start Your App
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

### Stop Your App
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml down
```

### See What's Running
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps
```

### See Logs (if something goes wrong)
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f
```

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Problem: "Port already in use"
**Solution:** Stop other apps using ports 80, 3000, 8000, 5432, 6379

### Problem: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** Run Command Prompt as Administrator (Windows) or use `sudo` (Mac/Linux)

### Problem: "Docker not running"
**Solution:** Open Docker Desktop and wait for it to start

### Problem: "Can't connect to database"
**Solution:** Wait longer (first startup takes time) or restart:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml restart
```

## 🔒 Security Reminders

1. **Never share your SECRET_KEY** - it's like your app's password
2. **Change the default passwords** after first login
3. **Don't use this for real money** until you know what you're doing

## 📞 Need Help?

If you get stuck:
1. Check the logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f`
2. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
3. Make sure you copied the SECRET_KEY correctly
4. Make sure you saved the `.env.prod` file

## 🎯 What Just Happened?

You just:
- ✅ Created a secure configuration file
- ✅ Built your app into containers (like shipping containers for code)
- ✅ Started a database to store your data
- ✅ Started a web server to show your app
- ✅ Put everything behind a security guard (Nginx)

**Your app is now running like a real website!** 🌟
